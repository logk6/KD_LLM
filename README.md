# Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation

## 1 Environment Setup

```
conda create --name tinyllm python=3.9 -y
conda activate tinyllm
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

## 2 Quick Start

### 2.1 Obtaining Rationales

The following template should be provided as input to facilitate the teacher model generate rationales.

> Question:
>
> The sun is responsible for
>
> Options:
>
> (a) puppies learning new tricks
>
> (b) children growing up and getting old
>
> (c) flowers wilting in a vase
>
> (d) plants sprouting, blooming and wilting
>
> Answer:
>
> d
>
> Rationale:
>
> Let's think step by step.

With the teacher-forcing strategy, we add two randomly selected **in-context examples** of the same dataset to the input so the teacher model can generate a more accurate rationale.


### 2.2 JSON Files Generation

If you want to use multiple teachers, you can mimic the JSON format of the path `datasets/piqa/llm` to generate your own file, which will be explained in detail below using the third line in `train_CoT_0.json` as an example.

### 2.3 Learning from Multiple LLMs

#### Arguments

- `--from_pretrained`: `google/flan-t5-large`, `google/flan-t5-base`, `google/flan-t5-small`
- `--dataset`: `obqa`, `arc`, `piqa`, `riddle`, `pubmedqa`, `bioasq`
- `--gamma`: Ground-truth label weight for multi-task training
- `--alpha`: FLAN-T5 rationale weight for multi-task training
- `--beta`: LLaMA-2 rationale weight for multi-task training
- `--batch_size`: Batch size
- `--eval_steps`: How many steps to evaluate the model during training
- `--max_steps`: Maximum steps for training

#### Examples
